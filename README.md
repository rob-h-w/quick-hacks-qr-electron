This is a car crash between [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) and [Nayuki's QR code generator](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator).

It is intended as a quick hacked together way of generating QR codes platform independently without having to updload the contents to a 3rd party.
